# Lone Star Roam — next session kickoff

**No active priority track.** The Texas Brands track (Bucky's, H-E-Buddy,
Lone Star Compute — 3 waves) shipped 2026-07-12 and is folded into
`ROADMAP.md`; `BRANDS_SPEC.md` stays as history. A follow-up player-controlled
brand-size feature (`[`/`]`, own `lonestar-brand-scale` localStorage key) also
shipped 2026-07-12 on top of it — see the `brands.js` gotcha below. Queued
work lives in `BACKLOG.md`; pending playtests are there too. Pick the next
effort from `BACKLOG.md` (or start a new multi-wave spec per the `CLAUDE.md`
protocol) — there's no `## Session briefing` block, so the greeting stays
quiet until the next spec writes one.

Gotchas for whoever touches `brands.js` next:
- Each spawned site's hero/props are split across TWO parents: the scalable
  `building` sub-group (holds staticMesh/signPanel/props, carries
  `.scale.setScalar(SCALE)`) and `group` itself (billboards only, at Bucky's).
  If you add a new prop, decide which one it belongs in — anything that
  should shrink/grow with the store goes in `building`; anything that must
  stay grounded on its OWN terrain sample independent of store size (like the
  approach billboards) stays a direct `group` child with its own `.scale`.
- The foundation skirt's authored depth is `(relief + 0.4) / SCALE` —
  deliberately counter-scaled so its WORLD-space reach stays constant
  regardless of brand size (a shrunk building's shrunk skirt would otherwise
  float off sloped real terrain; El Paso's H-E-Buddy lot, ~1.8u relief, is
  the worst real case and is what the verify check exercises). Don't
  "simplify" this back to a plain `relief + 0.4` — that reintroduces the float
  at any scale below 1.
- `footAt`'s footprint half-extents and `PAD_TOP` are also scaled by the same
  module-level `SCALE`, so the walkable pad always matches the rendered slab.
  `SCALE` is read live (not cached) — the footprint site caches
  (`buckyFootprints()` etc.) only cache the scale-INDEPENDENT geometry
  (`padY`/`heading`/`x`/`z`), never the scale factor itself.

Gotchas for whoever touches `hud.js` next:
- The road shield is a CSS-3D chrome card: `this.shield` (constructor) is the
  `#road-shield-wrap` div (position/`.centered`/per-frame transform),
  `this.shieldCanvas` is the inner `<canvas id="road-shield">` (2D face
  raster). Don't conflate the two — `drawShield` draws on `shieldCanvas`,
  `animateShield` transforms `shield`.
- `drawShield`'s raster is cached on a `ref+night` key (`_shieldKey`, bumping
  `_shieldRaster` only on a real redraw) — don't add per-frame canvas work
  there; motion is a pure CSS transform via `animateShield`, called once per
  render frame from `main.js`, ungated by `__skipRender`.
- Road shields only parse clean "PREFIX ###" refs (`parseShield`) — messy
  municipal names like "Southwest Loop 410" intentionally fall through to the
  plain text line; don't try to make the regex swallow those.
- `#hud-speed`/`#hud-mode` offsets (index.html) are rem-based on purpose so
  their gap scales with UI-scale text growth — if either block grows taller,
  bump the other's `bottom` in rem too, and rerun the "never overlaps" hud
  check before shipping.

Background context for the session:

We're on **Lone Star Roam** (`~/claude-area/devel/tx`), the Three.js
free-roam Texas game. Before touching code read `CLAUDE.md` (architecture
+ commands + gotchas). `MODULES.md` has per-module grep anchors — prefer
grep + a targeted read over whole-file reads. `ROADMAP.md` is history;
`BACKLOG.md` holds all other queued work and pending playtests.

Key facts:
- **Repo is private, GitHub Pages is deleted** (intentional) — the game is
  not currently live/public. Verify locally only.
- Local dev: `python3 -m http.server 8317`; verify headlessly with
  **`node tools/verify.mjs`** (parallel pool, full run ~24 s; compact; `-v`
  per-check, `-j N` sets width). Add checks to `tools/checks/*.mjs`, never
  throwaway scripts.
- Verify at *natural* play values (ugly mid-drive headings, parked-truck
  distances, off-axis approaches), not convenient ones.
- If I report something broken after an update, suspect my browser cache
  first (hard refresh — python http.server sends no cache headers).
- **Ask before coding** — present an implementation plan and wait for
  the go-ahead.
